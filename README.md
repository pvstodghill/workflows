# workflows

THIS REPOSITORY IS OBSOLETE!

Once upon a time, this repository contained a collection of my bioinformatics workflows. I have since decided to refactor this single repository into a colection of repositories, one for each discrete "stepXXX" module. Each of the modules in this repository is being migrated to its own toplevel repository. E.g., the directory `stepXXX-fastqc` (if I had gotten around to implementing it, which I didn't) can how be found at [pvstodghill/stepXXX-fastqc](https://github.com/pvstodghill/stepXXX-fastqc).
